## 📁 Project Description  
This project is based on a dataset containing information about **data science job salaries across various countries and roles**. The objective is to visualize important insights like:

- Top-paying job titles  
- Salary by employment type  
- Country-wise salary comparisons  
- Experience-level impact on pay

As a data analyst, it's crucial to turn raw datasets into meaningful visuals and KPIs. I divided the project into **5 key stages**:

1. Loading the dataset  
2. Cleaning and structuring the data  
3. Creating calculated fields for analysis  
4. Exploring trends using Pivot Tables  
5. Designing the final dashboard with slicers and visuals

The end result is a clean, user-friendly Excel dashboard that communicates salary insights effectively to stakeholders or job seekers in the data science field.
